# Week 11 Bringing Together Spring MVC, Spring Data and Inversion of Control

## Spring Data

previously we looked at  SpringMVC and SpringData 

This week we have an example which combines both together. 
[webfacadeexample2-spring](../week11/webfacadeexample2-spring )
 
This example treats SpringMVC and SpringData seperately with a set of ObjectFactories to bring the layers together.
