# Week 11 Bringing Together Spring MVC, Spring Data and Inversion of Control

## Spring Data

previously we looked at  SpringMVC and SpringData 

This week we have examples which combine both together. 


[webfacadeexample2-spring](../week11/webfacadeexample2-spring ) uses SpringMVC and SpringData seperately with a set of ObjectFactories to bring the layers together.

[webfacadeexample2-allspring](../week11/webfacadeexample2-allspring ) 
omits all of the Object Factories and simply uses Spring to wire the application.
This version uses EclipseLink and Derby


[webfacadeexample2-allspringhibernate](../week11/webfacadeexample2-allspring-hibernate ) 
omits all of the Object Factories and simply uses Spring to wire the application.
This version uses Hibernate and HSQLDB

[project](../week11/project) 
Project template reworked to only use Spring Data, SpringMVC, JSP, Hibernate JPA and HSQLDB
